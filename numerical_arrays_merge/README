Generalized algorithms to merge any number of sorted numerical (integer and decimal point) arrays into one sorted array.

(a) merge_n_lists.py is the main class that contains following functions to merge any number of sorted arrays:
1. All input arrays increasingly sorted. Output array increasingly sorted.
2. All input arrays decreasingly sorted. Output array decreasingly sorted.
3. All input arrays decreasingly sorted. Output array increasingly sorted.
4. All input arrays increasingly sorted. Output array decreasingly sorted.

(b)mergebase.py is the base class from which the above functions are derived. This class contains the following functions to merge two sorted arrays:
1. Input two arrays increasingly sorted. Output array increasingly sorted.
2. Input two arrays decreasingly sorted. Output array decreasingly sorted.
3. Input two arrays decreasingly sorted. Output array increasingly sorted.
4. Input two arrays increasingly sorted. Output array decreasingly sorted.
5. Input two arrays increasingly and decreasingly sorted respectively. Output array increasingly sorted.
6. Input two arrays increasingly and decreasingly sorted respectively. Output array decreasingly sorted.
7. Input two arrays decreasingly and increasingly sorted respectively. Output array decreasingly sorted.
8. Input two arrays decreasingly and increasingly sorted respectively. Output array increasingly sorted.

All working examples are provided in the codes.
